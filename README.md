# Inheritance

- Inheritance is a mechanism that passes traits of a parent class to its descendants, which helps prevents duplication of code

## Practice

- Create a new `Person` class and have it's constructor function take in parameters for first name, last name, and age
  - Create an instance method called `introduce` which will introduce the person by using `console.log` with a string saying, "Hi, I'm `first` `last`, and I'm `age` years old.".
  - Create a static method called `introducePeople` that will introduce an array of `Person` instances
    - Have the method console.log an error message if the argument is not type array
    - Have the method console.log an error message if the any of the items in the array are not instances of the `Person` class
- Create a new `Student` class and have it's constructor call the `super()`, passing the parameters needed for a `Person` and a constructor function that takes in parameters for their major subject and GPA.
  - Create a static method called `compareGPA` which will take in two students and compare return a string comparing the GPAs
    - `console.log` "`first` `last` has the higher GPA"
    - If they're equal, `console.log` "Both students have the same GPA"
